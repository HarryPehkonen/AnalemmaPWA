### **Project Analemma: PWA Requirements Document v1.0**

#### 1.0 Vision & Mission

*   **Project Name:** Project Analemma (working title)
*   **Application Type:** Progressive Web App (PWA)
*   **Mission:** To provide a simple, elegant, and fast utility that instantly shows users the time of local solar noon ("high noon") and visualizes the sun's position on the yearly analemma for their specific location.

#### 2.0 Core Functional Requirements

These are the features the application **must** perform.

**2.1 Location Detection**
*   **2.1.1:** Upon first launch, the application MUST request permission from the user to access their device's location (latitude and longitude).
*   **2.1.2:** If permission is granted, the app MUST use this location for all its calculations. The app should refresh this location on subsequent visits to ensure accuracy.
*   **2.1.3:** If permission is denied, the app MUST display a clear message explaining that location is required for it to function and provide a button to re-request permission. The app will be in a non-functional state until permission is granted.

**2.2 Solar Noon Time Display**
*   **2.2.1:** The application's primary display element MUST be the calculated time of solar noon for the user's current location and the current date. This calculation will be performed in real-time within the application.
*   **2.2.2:** This time MUST remain visible and accurate for the current date, even if the time has already passed for that day.
*   **2.2.3:** The time format SHOULD be clear and localized (e.g., `12:38:15 PM`) or in 24-hour format, respecting user system settings if possible.

**2.3 Analemma Visualization**
*   **2.3.1:** The application MUST display a graphical representation of the Earth's analemma.
*   **2.3.2 (Pre-calculation):** To ensure accuracy and performance, the set of 366 coordinates (to account for leap years) that form the analemma path MUST be pre-calculated during development and stored as a static data file within the application.
*   **2.3.3:** The analemma path itself MUST be rendered as a clean, continuous figure-eight line using the pre-calculated data.
*   **2.3.4:** A distinct marker, represented by a "sunny icon" (e.g., ☀️ emoji or a custom SVG), MUST be placed on the analemma path. Its position will be determined by looking up the current day of the year in the pre-calculated data file.
*   **2.3.5 (Hemisphere Orientation):** The orientation of the analemma MUST correctly reflect the user's hemisphere:
    *   For latitudes > 0° (Northern Hemisphere), the analemma's smaller loop MUST be at the top.
    *   For latitudes < 0° (Southern Hemisphere), the analemma MUST be inverted, with the larger loop at the top.

**2.4 Directional Indicator**
*   **2.4.1:** The application MUST display an arrow at the bottom of the screen indicating the direction to look to see the analemma in the sky.
*   **2.4.2:** For latitudes > 0° (Northern Hemisphere), the arrow MUST point South and be labeled "S".
*   **2.4.3:** For latitudes < 0° (Southern Hemisphere), the arrow MUST point North and be labeled "N".
*   **2.4.4 (Equator Edge Case):** For a latitude of exactly 0°, the arrow MUST point North.

#### 3.0 Non-Functional Requirements

These define the qualities and constraints of the system.

*   **3.1 Platform:** The application will be a PWA, built with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
*   **3.2 Installability:** The PWA MUST be installable ("Add to Home Screen") on supported mobile and desktop browsers.
*   **3.3 Offline Capability:** The application MUST be functional offline. After the first successful launch with an internet connection, it should load and operate without network access, using the last known location for its calculations.
*   **3.4 Performance:** The application MUST load quickly and have a responsive, fluid user interface. All calculations should feel instantaneous.
*   **3.5 Privacy:** Location data MUST only be used on the client-side for calculations. It MUST NOT be stored, tracked, or transmitted to any server.
*   **3.6 Testing:** The application should have thorough tests for as many aspects of the code as is reasonable.

#### 4.0 User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX) Guidelines

*   **4.1 Layout:** A single-screen, vertical layout is required:
    1.  **Top:** Solar Noon Time
    2.  **Middle:** Analemma Visualization
    3.  **Bottom:** Directional Indicator
*   **4.2 Visual Style:** Clean, modern, and minimalist. A dark mode/space theme is highly recommended to enhance the astronomical theme.
*   **4.3 Directional Arrow Style:** The arrow should be designed to have a "3D look" through the use of gradients, shadows, or perspective (e.g., using CSS transforms) to make it a high-quality visual element.
*   **4.4 Typography:** Fonts must be highly legible and clear.
